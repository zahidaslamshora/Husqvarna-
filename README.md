Sure, here's a well-organized and formatted description of your interview assessment project with Husqvarna, which you can present to the interviewer:

## Husqvarna Interview Assessment Project

### Overview

This project consists of three web services: **Course**, **Student**, and **Allocation**. These services operate on an H2 database, which can be accessed via the following URL: [H2 Database Console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console/).

### Course Web Service

The **Course** web service provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing courses. You can perform the following actions:

- **Add Course**: `/course/add-Course`
- **Get Courses**: `/course/get-Courses`
- **Update Course**: `/course/update-Course`
- **Delete Course**: `/course/delete-Course/{courseName}`

### Student and Allocation Web Services

The **Student** and **Allocation** web services are responsible for registering student details and allocating courses to students. Here are the key actions you can perform:

- **Register Student**: `/student/register-student`
- **Get Students**: `/student/get-Student`
- **Allocate Courses to Students**: `/allocation/allocate`
- **Get Students with Selected Courses**: `/allocation/with-courses`
- **Update Allocated Course for Student**: `/allocation/update-allocated-course`

### Using Rest Template

We use the Rest Template to consume the **Course** web service from the **Student** web service. The endpoint `/student/get-courses-student` is used to fetch courses and is associated with the `/course/get-Courses` API.

### Sequential Steps

To ensure smooth execution and demonstrate the functionality of the web services, follow these steps:

1. Start by visiting [http://localhost:8080/welcome](http://localhost:8080/welcome) to access the welcome page.
2. Create courses using the `/course/add-Course` endpoint.
3. Fetch courses with the `/course/get-Courses` endpoint.
4. Update a course using the `/course/update-Course` endpoint.
5. To verify that we can consume the course web service from the student web service, use the `/student/get-courses-student` endpoint.
6. Register students on the website using the `/student/register-student` endpoint.
7. Fetch the list of students using the `/student/get-Student` endpoint.
8. Allocate courses to students and add them to the database via the `/allocation/allocate` endpoint.
9. To retrieve students with their selected courses, access the `/allocation/with-courses` endpoint.
10. Update a course for a student using the `/allocation/update-allocated-course` endpoint.
11. Delete a course using the course name provided in the first step through the `/course/delete-Course/{courseName}` endpoint.
12. Delete a student using the student name via the `/student/delete-Student/{studentName}` endpoint.

All of the above web services have been thoroughly tested using POSTMAN to ensure their functionality and reliability.

Presenting the project in this structured manner will allow you to convey a clear understanding of the project's components and the flow of actions. It also shows your attention to detail and readiness for discussing the project during the interview.
